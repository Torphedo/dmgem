# DMG Emulator

This is a WIP emulator for the original Game Boy (DMG). It aims to be relatively
accurate with a wide range of compatibility. I am attempting to support as many
different cartridge types as possible.


## Progress / Current State
Currently, the emulator supports *most* CPU instructions and has mostly working
cartridge memory functionality.
